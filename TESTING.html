		<h2>Late Postclassical Catholicism</h2>
			
			<p>Read “Roman Catholic Church during the Middle Ages” (pages 224–225).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What were the characteristics and developments of Roman Catholicism in Western Europe from 1000–1450?</li>
				<li>Key Terms: bishops, pope, priests, Babylonian Captivity</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>Throughout the Postclassical centuries, the church was the strongest common bond across Western Europe. Not only was it the one institution you could find almost everywhere, but its teachings shaped how most people viewed their lives and the larger world around them. It was not only religious, according to our current divisions of knowledge, but also intellectual, artistic, and cultural.</p>

		<p>In the later Middle Age, the church had accumulated greater unity, wealth, and power. By the time of the Great Schism in the eleventh century, the pope had become the supreme head of the church, answerable to no other religious official, the only one who could call church councils and be more independent from political control. A strong symbol of this was Pope Gregory VII, who excommunicated the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, whereas Henry’s predecessor had removed three popes.</p>

		<p>Just as in the Muslim world at about the same time, there was significant controversy over how best to approach God and find truth. Peter Abelard preached that study and logic were the best ways to do it, and in his work, Yes and No (from 1120), he exposed many logical contradictions in traditional interpretations of church doctrines. “By doubting,” he wrote, “we come to inquire and by inquiry we arrive at truth.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  If Abelard’s approach was similar to that of the ulama scholars and the students of the philosophers in the Muslim world, Bernard of Clairvaux’s approach was more like that of the mystical Sufis. This monk felt that faith alone led to truly satisfying, personal union with the divine. God, he believed, must be felt through personal experience more than studied in books.</p>
			
			<center><img src="../Media/Images/2.6_Thomas_Aquinas.jpg" alt="Thomas Aquinas, highly influential scholastic of the High Middle Ages and author of Summa Theologica."/></center>
			<div class="caption"><a href="../../../../Templates/Footnote1"></a>Thomas Aquinas, highly influential scholastic of the High Middle Ages and author of Summa Theologica.<a href="#fn3" id="ref3"><sup>3</a></sup></div>
			
			
			
		<p>Thomas Aquinas finally reconciled the competing methods of Abelard and Clairvaux for finding the truth of God later in the thirteenth century. Similar to the conclusions al-Ghazali had reached in the Abbasid Caliphate over a century before, Aquinas concluded that faith came first but reason retained a large role. God speaks in different ways, through both the thunderous “Thou shalt not kill” to assembled Israel in the Old Testament but also by the quietly confirming voice of conscience to each individual. Reason, to Aquinas, allowed mankind to learn much of the moral order and nature of God, but not all of it. The highest fulfillment was found only in the faithful contemplation of the divine.</p>

		<p>Furthermore, Aquinas believed all truth could be compiled into one majestic whole. In an extraordinary effort of Aristotelean classification and Christian conviction, he dictated Summa Theologica (c. 1265–1274) to synthesize all knowledge worth knowing. In its five volumes, containing over three thousand articles, he led readers from the nature of God into the characteristics of his creations, down to mankind, through Christ and the sacraments, and back to God again. He cited classical philosophers, Christian fathers, and Muslim thinkers as he carefully explained his subjects by answering almost endless questions about them. This method of showing the logical orderliness of all knowledge is called scholasticism, and it became the central occupation of many late Postclassical scholars in meticulous writings and intricate debates probing the deepest details of existence. Perhaps appropriately, Aquinas never finished his monumental work. After having a mystical experience while at mass a few months before his death, he claimed, “I cannot go on. . . . All that I have written seems to me like so much straw compared to what I have seen and what has been revealed to me.”<sup><a href="#4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

		<p>The most conspicuous monuments of the growing wealth, unity, and faith of the High Middle Ages were the Gothic cathedrals that rose over many medieval cities. These immense structures, some rising higher than the pyramids in Egypt to become the tallest manmade objects to date, were enormous expressions of faith and centers of art in their designs and decorations. They were also the product of sustained community effort, often taking decades to complete and advanced financing to build, which would certainly have been impossible without the prosperity of the times. Many cities hoped their cathedral would outdo that of their rivals and elevate their civic status as well as their prayers.</p>

			
		<h2>Consolidating Political Power</h2>
			
			<center><img src="../Media/Images/2.6_Bayeux_Tapestry.jpg" alt="Scene from the Bayeux Tapestry of the Battle of Hastings in 1066, during which the Norman forces of William the Conqueror defeated the English army of King Harold. "/></center>
			<div class="caption"><a href="../../../../Templates/Footnote1"></a>Scene from the Bayeux Tapestry of the Battle of Hastings in 1066, during which the Norman forces of William the Conqueror defeated the English army of King Harold. <a href="#fn5" id="ref5"><sup>5</a></sup></div>
			
			<p>Read “Political Trends in the Later Middle Ages” and “High Middle Ages” (pages 226–227).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What were the main developments in governments in late Postclassical times?</li>
				<li>Key Terms: Capetian kings, Estates General, estates, Otto I, Holy Roman Empire, investiture controversy, Normans, William the Conqueror (Battle of Hastings, 1066), Magna Carta (1215), Parliament, House of Lords, House of Commons (1265), Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453), Reconquista, tournaments, jousts</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>With many exceptions, feudalism began to weaken during the High Middle Ages as monarchs started to gain more direct power in certain places like France. The character of England was greatly changed when William the Conqueror installed the Normans as the ruling elite there after his victory in 1066. The sharp division between the Norman rulers and the Anglo-Saxon inhabitants helped shape England’s subsequent, unique political path.</p>

			<p>Centuries later, the Hundred Years’ War strongly sharpened nationalism in both France and England. During the first half of the war, English armies won battles in France, making it possible for the King of England (a descendant of the Normans who were of Viking-French ancestry) to almost become the ruler of France as well. In the second half of the struggle, the astonishing seventeen-year-old Joan of Arc rallied the French to resist English armies.</p>

			<p>Claiming inspiration from heavenly messengers and possessed of unyielding courage and devotion, Joan of Arc rallied her countrymen to begin evicting the invaders. Though she was later captured and burned at the stake, the English forces eventually withdrew, and both sides felt more strongly about their own national identities. The war also witnessed a strong shift in military weapons and tactics. Although knights were the dominant military force at the beginning, in early battles they were often brought low by the strong arrows of longbows. By the end of the war, cannons, when the worked right, could blow anything away.

			<h2>The Crusades</h2>
			
			
			<center><img src="../Media/Images/2.6_Crusaders.jpg" alt="Crusaders in battle, painted in the fourteenth 14th century"/></center>
			<div class="caption"><a href="../../../../Templates/Footnote1"></a>Crusaders in battle, painted in the fourteenth 14th century.<a href="#fn7" id="ref7"><sup>7</a></sup></div>
			
			<p>Read “Christian Crusades” (pages 227–229).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why did the Crusades happen, and what happened during and because of them?</li>
				<li>Key Terms: primogeniture, First Crusade (1095–1099), Fourth Crusade (1202–1204), Venice, Black Death (bubonic plague)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Although the Crusades ran from 1095–1292, it may be easier for you to remember them as occurring from about 1100–1300, through the heart of the High Middle Ages.</p>

			<p>After the triumphant but brutal conquest of Jerusalem and other areas in the Holy Land in the First Crusade, the knights who remained there had to govern the mostly Muslim population. Over the next generations, many Europeans tolerated or adopted Middle Eastern dress and other ways of life in a sort of convivencia (coexistence), similar to what Muslim rulers in Spain oversaw with the Jews and Christian there. Just as not all the causes of the Crusades were religious, once in the Holy Land, some of the actions of the Crusaders were driven by political and economic motivations. The rulers of Christian strongholds sometimes allied with Muslim leaders against common enemies.
			</p>
			
			<center><img src="../Media/Images/2.6_Crusader_Kingdoms.jpg" alt="Map of Crusader kingdoms (Christian kingdoms are marked with a red cross) about forty years after the First Crusade. "/></center>
			<div class="caption"><a href="../../../../Templates/Footnote1"></a>Map of Crusader kingdoms (Christian kingdoms are marked with a red cross) about forty years after the First Crusade.<a href="#fn8" id="ref8"><sup>8</a></sup></div>
			
			<p>The Third Crusade in the late twelfth century brought new armies of knights who were eager to conquer rather than compromise with the Muslims. Their zeal, though, helped Saladin unite the previously divided Muslim rulers in the area to retake Jerusalem. The Fourth Crusade ended up being a Western European conquest of Constantinople, intensifying the Catholic/Orthodox split.</p>

			<p>A disastrous “Children’s Crusade” followed soon afterward when a charismatic preacher persuaded parents to let their children march with him to the Holy Land. Through their pure piety, the children thought they would redeem not only the sacred ground itself but also the entire cause of the Crusades from the atrocities committed by earlier crusaders. Instead, some of the preacher’s followers starved on the way, some of their ships sank in the Mediterranean, and those who arrived in the Holy Land were sold into slavery.</p>

			<p>Later, more formal Crusades also accomplished little, and the last Christian kingdom in Palestine was conquered by Muslim forces in 1292. Despite the Crusades’ failure to accomplish their primary purpose, their consequences were significant in increasing connections with the people, ideas, products, and plagues of the Middle East.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Other Trends</h2>	
			
			<p>Here is a shotgun blast of late Postclassical European changes, some of which you have learned about before.</p>
			
			<p>Read “Economic and Social Change” (pages 229–232).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What major economic and social changes happened from 1000–1450?</li>
				<li>Key Terms: Marco Polo, cartography, middle class (bourgeoisie), burghers, Little Ice Age, Hanseatic League, guilds, Romanesque architecture, Gothic cathedrals, Christine de Pisan, Thomas Aquinas, scholasticism, religious orders, Knights Templar, Teutonic Knights, University of Paris, Cambridge, Oxford</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Now let’s put those fragments together. From 1000–1300, Western Europe generally became more secure, connected, and wealthy. Invasions occurred less often, and farming became more prosperous due to methods such as the three-field system and tools such as the moldboard plow and improved horse collars. Many people who had threatened the security of Western Europe, especially the Vikings, had become converted to Christianity. Catholicism and the universities it sponsored continued to grow in influence.</p>

			<p>Europeans could live in a variety of situations by 1300. Most were still farmers, and many were still serfs living on manors with obligations to and protection from their lords. Significant numbers of nobles and others sought the various rewards of crusading. Some people were craftsmen in the cities, living under the guidance and care of their guilds. A growing group of merchants pursued a more capitalist life, risking their investments on distant trade. And there were still large numbers of people who withdrew from temporal concerns to focus on spiritual matters in communities of faith in monasteries and cloisters. Each of these environments gave its inhabitants a different way of life and its own way of looking on the wider world.
			</p>
			
			<h2>The Plagued 1300s</h2>
			
			<p>Many of the optimistic trends of the High Middle Ages turned around in the 1300s. Farming could no longer keep up with population as the Little Ice Age set in with no new technological developments to increase production. The costs of scarce grain, dairy, and livestock rose. Famines became more frequent and peasant rebellions more common. Then came the plague.</p>

			<p>The plague had probably hit China in 1331 before the microbe spread across Eurasia through the Mongol khanates to the Middle East and the Mediterranean. By 1347, Genoese trading ships returning from the Black Sea had brought the infestation to Sicily, and from there it spread up into Italy and southern Germany. Other vessels transported it to France, England, and elsewhere. The crowded, unsanitary cities provided almost ideal conditions for the sickness to spread.</p>

			<p>With dawning terror, victims would first detect a growth the size of a large nut or small apple in their armpit, groin, or neck. This was the painful, large boil or bubo that gave the bubonic plague its name. Black splotches then appeared on the skin before violent coughs brought up blood and the foulest stench out of the body. In most cases, death arrived in two or three days. The coughing typically transmitted the disease to the charitable souls who tried to relieve the suffering. No one at the time, though, understood exactly how this malady spread, and there was no known cure.</p>

			<p>The plague of the 1300s killed at least a third of the population of Europe, possibly half. Some cities lost as much as two-thirds of their population, and some villages were wiped out entirely. At the same time, certain blood types offered protection from the disease, so places like Hungary were scarcely touched. Waves of plague returned every few decades well into the 1600s.</p>

			<p>Catholicism lost some of its vigor during these years when many people most needed its comforts. In the face of the plague, some survivors forsook their faith to enjoy their uncertain life span as much as they could. Others became more devout, including flagellants, as they were called, who beat or whipped themselves to afflict the flesh and strengthen the spirit. Some suspected that the plague came from Jews poisoning the wells of Christians, and the backlash in certain areas was ferocious.</p>

			<p>The struggles of the Catholic Church under the Babylonian Captivity and the time of three popes happened throughout the 1300s. These crises decreased the church’s influence and caused more to question its practices. Toward the end of the century, John Wycliffe came to consider the scriptures as the sole source of truth. He translated them into English so that more people could read them, and he denied all practices for which he could not find validation in those holy writings.</p>

			<p>Wycliffe eventually rejected many sacraments, the veneration of saints, monasticism, and even the idea of having a pope. He thought the church should not be as rich as it was at the time and that priests should live in poverty. Wycliffe died before he was declared a heretic in 1415 (his bones were dug up and burned in that year). But his writings inspired many, including Jan Hus, a Bohemian priest. Hus was burned alive as a heretic in 1415, but for the next twenty years his followers, known as Hussites, waged a devastating war in Central Europe.</p>

			<p>To add to these miseries, the Hundred Years’ War began in France in the late 1300s and stretched through the early 1400s, though the actual fighting, if put back-to-back, would last only a few weeks out of that century. Just as the 10th century, filled with invasions, had been a hard end to the early middle ages in Europe, the 1300s were an unfortunate end to the High Middle Ages.

			<h2>Renaissance</h2>

			<p>Read “Renaissance” (pages 232–234</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why did the Renaissance happen, and what did it do?</li>
				<li>Key Terms: humanism, Dante, The Divine Comedy (1320), Geoffrey Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales (1387), Erasmus, In Praise of Folly (1511)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Why Renaissance?</h2>
			
			<p>Renaissance means “rebirth.” It is usually used to mean a rebirth of the learning of the classical Greeks and Romans. As we have seen, that learning never entirely went away but had been collected in scattered monasteries in Europe and intellectual centers in the Muslim world. Chances to learn were often scarce in Postclassical times but were increasing during the High Middle Ages when the Renaissance began. When Constantinople was conquered by the Ottomans in 1453, many Greek scholars moved west, bringing their texts and knowledge with them. But the term Renaissance also referred to recovery from the plague. By the early 1400s, many people felt they had survived a terrible, chaotic time and were getting established again. Also emerging from the plagued 1300s was a small sense that the traditional authority of feudal lords or religious officials might be weakening due to the crises and trends of the times.</p>

			<p>Many factors built on each other to create the atmosphere that produced Renaissance art and thought. Its founding spirit was a man called Petrarch who lived during those dark 1300s. His father wanted him to become a lawyer, but he instead grew enamored with poetry and classical texts. He considered the centuries since the fall of Rome “Dark Ages” because he believed they had failed to produce works of a caliber comparable to those of the Roman Empire. As soon as he became an adult, he abandoned his legal studies to collect, scrutinize, and publicize as many of these classical works as he could find.</p>

			<p>The money from increased trade through the Italian city-states financed a lot of the Renaissance. It wasn’t just that there was a lot of money, but that those who had it were uneasy. As sometimes happens, many merchants found themselves with wealth but without social status comparable to that of the old, land-based aristocratic families. Patronizing the arts was one way in which they tried to make themselves more respectable and display their refined taste. Craft guilds often sponsored works of art as well to show their public-spiritedness.</p>

			<p>Political rivalries fueled the movement too. Italy was a collection of city-states, similar to ancient Greece. Warfare was frequent. Rulers vied to create the most magnificent court and strove to patronize and promote the finest artists. Furthermore, within each city-state, many families contended for power with great amounts of intrigue and bloodshed. The Medici family of Florence began as wool raisers and then moved into banking before taking power in the city in the early 1400s. Sponsoring promising artists was one way to display their civic pride and keep hold on the government.</p>

			<p>The political struggles in Florence were so severe that Niccolo Machiavelli, from a faction opposed to the Medici, wrote The Prince, a realistic guidebook for how to keep power during such times. One section, for instance, was titled “When to Keep Promises.” Another famous excerpt explains, “For a man who wants to make a profession of good in all regards must come to ruin among so many who are not good.” Another passage is responsible for the modern saying, “the ends justify the means.” Ruthless methods are still known as “Machiavellian” today. All of these factors helped create the restless energy that fueled the uncommon artistic output of the Renaissance.
			</p>
			
			<h2>The Italian Renaissance</h2>
			
			<center><img src="../Media/Images/2.6_Lorenzo.jpg" alt="Portrait of Lorenzo “The Magnificent” de’ Medici"/></center>
			<div class="caption"><a href="../../../../Templates/Footnote1"></a>Portrait of Lorenzo “The Magnificent” de’ Medici.<a href="#fn10" id="ref10"><sup>10</a></sup></div>
			
			<p>The city of Florence was the heart of the southern, or Italian, Renaissance. Famous Florentines had done notable things before the fifteenth century. Dante Alighieri wrote the Divine Comedy, (called a “comedy” because it ended happily) in the early fourteenth century. A friend of Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, wrote the Decameron later in that century. It was a collection of one hundred charming (and sometimes racy) tales told by ten characters who had fled Florence to escape the plague. In the fifteenth century, Filippo Brunelleschi saved Florence’s civic pride by devising a way to successfully construct a dome over the city’s Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral after the original architects left open a space in the ceiling, with no actual idea how to cover it. Scaffolding could not be used to hold up a dome, so Brunelleschi’s daring design, supported by the Medici despite potential risk to the family’s position, painstakingly placed more than four million bricks in a herringbone pattern that supported its own enormous weight as it was built. No wonder some thought the Florentines were the cleverest people in Italy.</p>

			<p>The height of the Italian Renaissance arrived in Florence by the year 1492. Lorenzo de’ Medici, known as Il Magnifico, was a generous patron of a wide variety of arts and was the guiding political spirit of the city. Among those he sponsored was Sandro Botticelli, who painted innovative political scenes as well as fanciful spectacles from ancient mythology.</p>

			<p>Most famous was Leonardo da Vinci, whose lively intellect, perhaps the broadest in the western world since Aristotle’s, investigated everything but finished almost nothing. His cryptic illustrated notes proceeded from how an eye looks to how the eye sees to considerations of optics in general. He started designing improved weapons and fortifications, a helicopter-like machine, central heating, and a breathing apparatus to take underwater, but the designs never became functional. Much of his thinking was lost shortly after his death when his notes were scattered as collector’s items, not to be regathered for centuries. Da Vinci was also a supremely talented painter, and his Mona Lisa is perhaps the most famous painting in the world.</p>

			<p>Michelangelo was just beginning his career in 1492 and would be known as Il Divino for statues such as his arrestingly lifelike David and for his paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, done under almost impossible conditions. Adding to the already frenzied rivalries in Florence, Da Vinci and Michelangelo despised each other.</p>

			<p>The Renaissance brought on a strong neoclassicism close to the same time Neo-Confucianism was surging in China. Its humanism was like that of ancient Greece: it did not deny the divine, but it proclaimed that humans mattered and that they could best glorify God by using the gifts and senses the Supreme Being had given them to investigate and beautify the world around them.</p>

			<p>The Italian Renaissance continued through the 1500s, but Florence fell on hard times. Lorenzo de’ Medici died in 1492, and his family was forced from power. A stern monk, Girolamo Savonarola, preached against Renaissance extravagance, encouraging his listeners to throw their wigs, perfumes, makeup, musical instruments, and irreligious art into a “Bonfire of the Vanities.” Botticelli and perhaps Michelangelo pitched in some of their works as Savonarola’s counter-Renaissance prevailed for a time. The monk welcomed a French invasion as a purifying force, but the crisis helped shift opinion against him, and Savonarola was burned at the stake for treason and religious heresy. Ongoing intrigues between the Italian city-states, with regular intervention from France and the Holy Roman Emperor, caused a turbulent century in the peninsula.
			</p>
			
			<h2>The Renaissance Moves North</h2>
			
			<center><img src="../Media/Images/2.6_Erasmus.jpg" alt="Erasmus was perhaps the leading Christian humanist thinker of the Northern Renaissance."/></center>
			<div class="caption"><a href="../../../../Templates/Footnote1"></a>Erasmus was perhaps the leading Christian humanist thinker of the Northern Renaissance.<a href="#fn11" id="ref11"><sup>11</a></sup></div>
			
			<p>Da Vinci lived his last years in France, and remarkable artistic achievement migrated north as well. The fairly new printing press and growing trade in Europe helped spread Italian Renaissance influences. King Francis I of France commissioned many works of art, and his son married Catherine de’ Medici, a granddaughter of Lorenzo. She brought considerable Renaissance influence to French art and music, including the beginnings of ballet.</p>

			<p>Many other countries experienced a surge in art, which not only inspired those who beheld it but also helped define their emerging nations and standardize their languages. In Spain, Miguel de Cervantes wrote Don Quixote at the start of the seventeenth century as a satire of the knightly romances that had been popular in Europe for over a century. His elderly hero has read so many of those adventure-filled books that he comes to believe he is a knight himself and roams around the countryside trying to do deeds of chivalry, much to the bemusement of the residents. The book is often considered the first modern novel and is such a literary masterpiece that many have called Spanish “the language of Cervantes.” In art, El Greco and Diego Velazquez became the most noted painters in Spain’s renaissance, called El Siglo de Oro, “the Century of Gold.”</p>

			<p>The English also had their “Elizabethan Renaissance” in the late 1500s and early 1600s. The most praised figure was William Shakespeare, a poet and playwright widely regarded as the finest author in the English language. In addition to Christian humanist writer Erasmus, the Low Countries (the Netherlands and Belgium) produced the “Dutch Masters” painters such as Rembrandt and Vermeer during their golden age in the 1600s. Nationalism grew for these and other reasons as the Renaissance moved north, with each country producing advanced works of art and literature, although not always competing in these fields as fiercely as the Italian city-states had done.
